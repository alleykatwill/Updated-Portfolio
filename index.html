                    Thank you for taking time to stop and look at my portfolio. I am currently a
                    student enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Chapel Hill. My portfolio
                    contains links to some of the work that I have done as part of the program from the starting
                    point through the middle of the program. While I have learned many new skills and
                    languages through the program, I still have a lot more to learn. I look forward to my
                    continued studies through the program and beyond.
                    
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Along with my enrollment with the UNC Coding Bootcamp, I am also a full-time student at the
                    University of Mount Olive. I am a senior working towards my degree in Management Information Systems. 
                    Prior to beginning at the University, I received an Associate's Degree from Wake Technical Community
                    College. I also have certifications from Johnston Community College in Spanish Language and Culture. 
                    I am currently employed at a pharmaceutical plant and have obtained my certification in BioWorks. My 
                    college courses have focused on business, Spanish and technology.

                </p>

                    Examples of the work that I have completed through UNC Coding Bootcamp are located in the Portfolio Section. A 
                    link to my resume is also located in this section. Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions or
